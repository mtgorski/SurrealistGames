Surrealist Games
=========================

Surrealist games is a website that lets users participate in games inspired by surrealist artistic
practices. Surrealist artists used these games to generate insights through random chance.
In one variation, the group would write down questions on small sheets of paper which
were then thrown into a pile. Next, the group would write down answers on other sheets
of paper. The questions and answers were then combined, yielding results such as
"What is ugliness? Forgotten dreams."

The website allows user to participate an online version of this game. Users will enter a question which is then matched with
an answer written by another user and the question will be saved
for future games played by others (mutatis mutandis for entering answers).

Future Improvements
----------------------------------
Users will also have the option to 
save results to a list of their favorites or report the result for inappropriate
content/spam etc. 

Website moderators will be able to view lists of reported submissions. They can
either remove them, approve them or prevent the user from making further reports. 

Website administrators will have moderator powers and in addition be able to approve
or dismiss moderators.
